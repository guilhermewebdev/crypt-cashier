- Since I am an client
  - I can generate a billing
    - I enter 
      - the value
      - due date, if it exists
    - It returns a wallet address
  - I can transfer the value to the generated wallet address
    - I can wait for the payment processing to be done
    - When it happens, my debit was finished
    - If I transfer more than necessary, the surplus is refunded
    - If I transfer less than necessary, I'm notified with missing value
